Stat 110 Cheatsheet
=======

Stat 110 allows you to have a page (front and back) of notes for the midterm. You can have two pages (front and back) for the final. This was the cheatsheet that I used, based off [William Chen's probability cheatsheet](https://github.com/wzchen/probability_cheatsheet) from when he was a teaching fellow (which is why some headings are labeled "Section #"). My edits are all in the first four pages. Pages 5-7 are all William. 

I basically used the first two pages (with some changes) for the midterm and the first four pages in the final. Fortunately I'm done with the class, but that also means that means I won't be touching this cheatsheet again. 

A few edits I would make if I were taking this class again:
- Create a table of distributions with their MGFs and CDFs (a table of distributions with their PMF/PDF, Mean, and Variance are already provided to you on the exam)
- Add a section on the chi-squared distribution 

I also wish that I had used this cheatsheet while I worked on homework and added things that I had trouble with to the cheatsheet.
